Hello:

I'm interested in applying for your published open position.

I believe I will be an asset for your team because I've been working as a
sysadmin since 2003 and even if things have changed a lot since then I've been
able to keep myself in the loop not because I'm an expert on a particular
technology, but because I've learned how to methodically work with new
technologies and get to master them. So I'm always open to new challenges.

Sincerely,

Jerem√≠as Casteglione
