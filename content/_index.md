Hello, my name is Jerem√≠as and I've been working as a sysadmin since 2003 and
even if things have changed a lot since then, I've been able to stay in the loop
not because I'm an expert on any particular topic but because I've learned how
to methodically work with new technologies, and get to master them. So I'm
always open to new challenges.

Please, check the links below if you are interested in my work and technical
experience.
